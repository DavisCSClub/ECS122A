\section{Definitions}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Polynomial Time (P): } Set of all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
	\item \textbf{Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP): } Set of all decision problems for which a ``yes"-instance can be accepted in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine. Another way to look at it is a set of all decision problems which given an instance of the problem and a certificate, it can be verified in polynomial time. 
	\item \textbf{NP-Hard: } Set of all problems for which every NP problem can be reduced to in polynomial time. Note that this is a set of all problems, not necessarily decision problems.
	\item \textbf{NP-Complete: } Set of all decision problems for which it is NP and NP-Hard and is reducible to any other NP problem in polynomial time.
