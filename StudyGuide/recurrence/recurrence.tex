\section{Recurrence Relations}
A recurrence relation is an equation that recursively defines a sequence of values. After the initial terms are given, each subsequent term is defined as a function of the previous terms.

\subsection{Fibonacci}
Fibonacci is an example of a recurrence relation.
$$
F_n = \begin{cases}
	F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, &  n \geq 2\\
	1, & n = 1\\
	0, & n = 0
\end{cases}
$$
The first two terms are defined while the subsequent terms are a function of the two previous.
